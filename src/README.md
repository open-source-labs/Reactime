# Developer README

## Brief
Our mission at Reactime is to maintain and iterate constantly, but never at the expense of future developers.<br />We know how hard it is to quickly get up to speed and onboard in a new codebase.<br />So, here are some helpful pointers to help you hit the ground running. 🏃🏾💨

## Quick Tips
- _Before_ beginning development, especially on teams, make sure to configure your linter and code formatting to conform to one unified setting (We recommend [the Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)!) This will make reviewing PRs much more readable and less error-prone.

## File Structure

In the *src* folder, there are three directories we care about: *app*, *backend*, and *extension*. 
```

1. The *app* folder is responsible for the Single Page Application that you see when you open the chrome dev tools under the Reactime tab.

2. The *backend* folder contains the set of all scripts that we inject into our "target" application via `background.js`
    - In Reactime, its main role is to generate data and handle time-jump requests from the background script in our *extension* folder.

![BACKEND DATA FLOW](../assets/backend.png)

3. The *extension* folder is where the `contentScript.js` and `background.js` are located. 
    - Like regular web apps, Chrome Extensions are event-based. The background script is where one typically monitors for browser triggers (e.g. events like closing a tab, for example). The content script is what allows us to read or write to our target web application, usually as a result of [messages passed](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/messaging) from the background script.
    - These two files help us handle requests both from the web browser and from the Reactime extension itself


## Diagramming
All the diagrams of data flows are avaliable on [MIRO](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lejUqLQ=/)
## Data Flow Architecture

The general flow of data is described in the following steps:

![GENERAL DATA FLOW](../assets/dataflow.jpg)

1. When the background bundle is loaded by the browser, it executes a script injection into the dom. (see section on *backend*). This script uses a technique called [throttle](https://medium.com/@bitupon.211/debounce-and-throttle-160affa5457b) to send state data from the app to the content script every specified milliseconds (in our case, this interval is 70ms).
<!--  CHECK LINE 496 IN LINKFIBER.TS -->


2. The content script always listens for messages being passed from the extension's target application. Upon receiving data from the target app, the content script will immediately forward this data to the background script which then updates an object called `tabsObj`. Each time `tabsObj` is updated, its latest version will be passed to Reactime, where it is processed for displaying to the user by the *app* folder scripts.

3. Likewise, when Reactime emits an action due to user interaction -- a "jump" request for example --  a message will be passed from Reactime via the background script to the content script. Then, the content script will pass a message to the target application containing a payload that represents the state the user wants the DOM to reflect or "jump" to.
    - One important thing to note here is that this jump action must be dispatched in the target application (i.e. *backend* land), because only there do we have direct access to the DOM.

## Console.log

Navigation between different console.log panels can be confusing when running Reactime. We created a short instruction where you can find the results for your console.log

### <b> /src/extension </b>
Console.logs from the Extension folder you can find here: 
- Chrome Extension (Developer mode)
- Background page 

![extension](../assets/extension-console.gif) 

### <b> /src/app </b>
Console.logs from the App folder you can find here: 
- Chrome Browser
- Inspect

![frontend](../assets/console.gif)

### <b> /src/backend </b>
Console.logs from the App folder you can find here: 
- Open the Reactime extension in Chrome
- Click "Inspect" on Reactime

## Chrome Developer Resources
Still unsure about what content scripts and background scripts do for Reactime, or for a chrome extensions in general?
  - The implementation details [can be found](./extension/background.js) [in the source files](./extension/contentScript.ts) themselves.
  - We also encourage you to dive into [the official Chrome Developer Docs](https://developer.chrome.com/home). 
  
  Some relevant sections are reproduced below:

> Content scripts are files that run in the context of web pages. 
>
> By using the standard Document Object Model (DOM), they are able to **read** details of the web pages the browser visits, **make changes** to them and **pass information back** to their parent extension. ([Source](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts))

- One helpful way to remember a content script's role in the Chrome ecosystem is to think: a *content* script is used to read and modify a target web page's rendered *content*. 

>A background page is loaded when it is needed, and unloaded when it goes idle.
>
> Some examples of events include:
>The extension is first installed or updated to a new version.
>The background page was listening for an event, and the event is dispatched.
>A content script or other extension sends a message.
>Another view in the extension, such as a popup, calls `runtime.getBackgroundPage`.
> 
>Once it has been loaded, a background page will stay running as long as it is performing an action, such as calling a Chrome API or issuing a network request.
>
> Additionally, the background page will not unload until all visible views and all message ports are closed. Note that opening a view does not cause the event page to load, but only prevents it from closing once loaded. ([Source](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/background_pages))

- You can think of background scripts serving a purpose analogous to that of a **server** in the client/server paradigm. Much like a server, our `background.js` listens constantly for messages (i.e. requests) from two main places:
  1. The content script
  2. The chrome extension "front-end" **(*NOT* the interface of the browser, this is an important distinction.)** 
- In other words, a background script works as a sort of middleman, directly maintaining connection with its parent extension, and acting as a proxy enabling communication between it and the content script.
