## Getting Started :rocket:

If you want to understand the codebase in more detail, take a look at our [Developer Guidelines](src/DEVELOPER_README.md). :confetti_ball:

### Issues :eyes:

#### Creating a New Issue :new:

1. **Check existing issues.**  
   Before opening a new issue, please [search if it already exists](https://github.com/open-source-labs/reactime/issues).

2. **Open your own issue.**  
   If you can’t find an existing issue, feel free to [open a new one](https://github.com/open-source-labs/reactime/issues/new) to report bugs, request features, or suggest improvements.

#### Solving an Issue :wrench:

1. **Pick an issue.**  
   Browse through our [open issues](https://github.com/open-source-labs/reactime/issues). We don’t officially assign them, so if something sparks your interest, go for it!

2. **Open a pull request.**  
   Once you’re ready to propose a fix or feature, you can open a PR referencing the issue you’re solving.

### Make Changes :rainbow:

#### Small Edits in the UI :pencil2:

- Click **Make a contribution** at the bottom of any documentation page to quickly fix typos, broken links, or small wording changes.
- This will take you directly to the `.md` file, where you can make edits and open a pull request.

#### Larger Changes Locally :computer:

1. **Install Git LFS.**  
   Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

2. **Fork the Repository.**

   - **GitHub Desktop:**  
     [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) walks you through setup. Then, you can [fork the repo](https://github.com/open-source-labs/reactime.git) right from GitHub Desktop!
   - **Command Line:**  
     [Fork the repo](https://github.com/open-source-labs/reactime.git) and clone your fork locally so you can work on your own copy.

3. **Create a working branch.**  
   Name it something descriptive (e.g., `feature/new-feature` or `fix/typo-in-docs`).

### Commit Your Changes :white_check_mark:

When you’re happy with your updates:

1. **Commit them locally.**  
   Write clear commit messages describing _what_ you changed and _why_.

2. **Push to your branch.**  
   This makes your changes visible on GitHub.

### Open a Pull Request :arrows_counterclockwise:

Once you’ve finished working and pushed your code:

1. **Create the PR.**  
   Click on **Compare & pull request** on your branch to open a new PR.

2. **Fill the “Ready for review” template.**  
   This helps reviewers quickly understand the context and purpose of your changes.

3. **Link Issues.**  
   If your PR fixes or relates to an existing issue, [link it](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) in the PR description.

4. **Allow Maintainer Edits.**  
   Check the box so our team can help update your branch if needed.

5. **Address Feedback.**  
   If reviewers suggest changes, you can:

   - Apply **suggested changes** directly on the GitHub UI.
   - Make edits in your local branch and push them.

6. **Resolve Conversations.**  
   Mark each PR comment as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations) once you’ve addressed it.

7. **Handle Merge Conflicts.**  
   Check out [this tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) if you get stuck.

## Your PR is Merged! :tada:

**Congratulations and thank you!** :dancer: :dancer: Once we merge your PR, your contributions become part of Reactime. We appreciate every contribution, and we hope you’ll stick around for more.
